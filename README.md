# dev-config

The home for my neovim configuration. Will likely be extended as I craft my PDE.

## Working features:
* Telescope
* LSP (C++ only, for now)
  * Diagnostics
  * Autocompletion
* Snippets
* StatusLine
* Basic debugging (again, C++ only)

## To be added:
* Advanced debugging with VScode `launch.json` files
* Linting
* Formatting
* Commenting
* Auto-pairing
